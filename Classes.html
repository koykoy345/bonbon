            <p>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome to sample this <br> 60-minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized movementâ€”you will inhale and exhale as <br> you flow energetically through yoga poses.</p></section>

            <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
            <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
